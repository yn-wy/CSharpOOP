## Project structure
A directory named `LectureX` is made for every lecture where `X` is the number of the lecture.
A directory named `ExerciseY.Z` is made for every class exercise inside the lecture directory.
where `Y` is the number of the main exercise and `Z` is the number of the sub-exercise. If there
are no sub-exercises in an exercise then `Z` is simply `0` for that exercise.
